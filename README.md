# Sales-Analysis-EDA
This project leverages Python's data analytics ecosystem—primarily using Pandas, Seaborn—to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on sales data. The oNumPy, Matplotlib, and bjective is to uncover key business insights, detect seasonal trends, evaluate sales performance metrics, and identify potential growth opportunities.


 #Objective & Key Skills Used:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Improved Customer Experience by identifying potential customers across different states,
  occupation , etc.
- Data Visualization & Reporting
- Improved sales by identifynig most selling products  catagories and product,
  which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands. 
- KPI Evaluation (e.g., Age & Gender, Occupation , region-wise performance)
- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
